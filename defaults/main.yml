# go_dev_env_insecure: [] # GOINSECURE: List of glob patterns (in the syntax of Go's path.Match) of module path prefixes that should always be fetched in an insecure manner. Only applies to dependencies that are being fetched directly, and does not disable checksum database validation. 
# go_dev_env_private: [] # GOPRIVATE: List of glob patterns (in the syntax of Go's path.Match) of module path prefixes that the go command considers to be private and should therefore not use the proxy or checksum database
# go_dev_env_no_proxy: [] # GONOPROXY: List of glob patterns (in the syntax of Go's path.Match) of module path prefixes that allow bypassing the proxy for selected modules. This will override any defined value for GOPRIVATE.
# go_dev_env_no_sumdb: [] # GONOSUMDB: List of glob patterns (in the syntax of Go's path.Match) of module path prefixes that allow bypassing checksum database validation for selected modules. This will override any defined value for GOPRIVATE.
